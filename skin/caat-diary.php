	The events we can list on this page are generally limited to those related to the arms trade.
	However, the Network for Peace has an <a href="http://www.networkforpeace.org.uk/calendar" class="external" title="open the Network for Peace diary in a new window">online diary</a> which aims to carry information on all peace movement events and also lists some
	other social justice events.
